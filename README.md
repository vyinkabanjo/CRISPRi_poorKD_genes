# CRISPR_HUSH_lib
A repository for my summer 2022 project in the Weissman Lab that involves the use of genome-wide perturb-seq data to identify genes recalcitrant to the effect of CRISPRi knockdown in the K562 cell line and designing a gRNA sublibrary that can allow its users to target those genes. Supervised by Yi Hua Chen and Tessa Bertozzi.
