# CRISPRi_poor_kd_genes
A repository for my summer 2022 project in the Weissman Lab that involves the use of genome-wide perturb-seq data to identify genes recalcitrant to the effect of CRISPRi knockdown (kd) in the K562 cell line and designing a gRNA sublibrary that can allow its users to target those genes. Supervised by Yi Hua Chen and Tessa Bertozzi.  

This analysis was done on a server and because of the size of the single cell and bulk genome-wide h5ad anndata files used in my analysis (K562_gwps_normalized_singlecell_01.h5ad), I did not download them. However, they can be accessed via this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422005979?via%3Dihub
